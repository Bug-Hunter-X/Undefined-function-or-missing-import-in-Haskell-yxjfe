The solution depends on the nature of the undefined function. If it's from another module, you need to import that module:

```haskell
-- bugSolution.hs
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let unsortedList = [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6]
  let sortedList = sort unsortedList
  print sortedList
```

If the function is meant to be defined within the current file, you need to add the function definition before its usage:

```haskell
-- bugSolution.hs
mySum :: [Int] -> Int
mySum xs = sum xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let listSum = mySum myList
  print listSum
```
